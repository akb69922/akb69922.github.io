The Met Gala is a special event in the fashion industry that occurs on the first Monday in May.
Because fashion is a wonderful ability to express who you are, what you feel on the inside, and what your personality says about you,
there is endless versatility in the outfits of superstars who attend. Every year there is a chosen theme.
Everyone must dress according to the theme, but can fully express their personalities through their creations.
Fashion designers select a man or woman to dress, and then we see the designer walk along the runway beside them.
This is such an iconic moment in fashion because the Metropolitan Museum in New York City benefits from donations made by the elite. Therefore,
they are able to provide new and exciting art exhibits for all the public to enjoy.
